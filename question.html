            <p class="text-xl font-bold">Question 1: What is the difference between map, filter, forEach and find? </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-bold text-green-700">Answer:</span> <br>
                map: returns a new array with the identical period as the
                authentic array, where each element has been converted primarily based on a callback feature that you
                provide. The original array is not modified. <br> <br>

                filter: returns a new array containing the best elements from the original array that fulfil a positive
                circumstance targeted with the aid of a callback function that you offer. <br> <br>

                forEach: executes a supplied function once for each detail in an array. It does not go back an array,
                and it no longer adjusts the authentic array. <br> <br>

                find: returns the first element in the array that satisfies a positive circumstance unique by way of a
                callback feature that you provide. If no element satisfies the condition, undefined is returned. </p>
