            <p class="text-xl font-bold"><span class="text-red-700">Question 1:</span> What is the difference between
                map, filter, forEach and find? </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-bold text-green-700">Answer:</span> <br>
                map: returns a new array with the identical period as the
                authentic array, where each element has been converted primarily based on a callback feature that you
                provide. The original array is not modified. <br> <br>

                filter: returns a new array containing the best elements from the original array that fulfil a positive
                circumstance targeted with the aid of a callback function that you offer. <br> <br>

                forEach: executes a supplied function once for each detail in an array. It does not go back an array,
                and it no longer adjusts the authentic array. <br> <br>

                find: returns the first element in the array that satisfies a positive circumstance unique by way of a
                callback feature that you provide. If no element satisfies the condition, undefined is returned. </p>

            <p class="text-xl font-bold"><span class="text-red-700">Question 2:</span> What is the difference between
                local storage, sessionion storage, cookies?</p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-bold text-green-700">Answer:</span> <br>
                localStorage: The data stored in localStorage save even after the browser window is closed, so it can be
                accessed later. <br>
                sessionStorage: This is similar to localStorage, but the data stored in sessionStorage is cleared when
                the browser window is closed. <br>
                cookies: Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client-side browser.They can be used to store
                information about a user's preferences or login status.Cookies can be deleted by the browser.

            <p class="text-xl font-bold"><span class="text-red-700">Question 3:</span> What is event loop, How it is
                work?</p> <br>
            <p class="font-semibold text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-bold text-green-700">Answer:</span> <br>
                The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that enables asynchronous programming. It is responsible for
                managing the execution of code in a single-threaded environment by processing events and callbacks. <br>

            <p class="text-xl font-bold"><span class="text-red-700">Question 4:</span> How quizTimer function work?</p>
            <br>

            <p class="font-semibold text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-bold text-green-700">Answer:</span> <br>
                This is a function called quizTimer that takes one parameter called dismiss.

                If the dismiss parameter is truthy the
                function clears an interval timer by calling clearInterval and passing in the variable timer. The
                clearInterval method stops the interval timer that was created using setInterval earlier in the code.

            <p class="text-xl font-bold"><span class="text-red-700">Question 5:</span> How chooseQuiz function work?</p>

            <p class="font-semibold text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-bold text-green-700">Answer:</span>
                The chooseQuiz function updates the answers array with the answer to a selected quiz question. It checks if an answer has already been recorded for the quiz question and updates it if it has, or creates a new entry if it hasn't. Finally, it calls the displayAnswers function to update the display of quiz answers.
